Django Workflow

1     Create a new project and a new app called mainapp
	django-admin.py startproject [name]
	cd into directory
	django-admin.py startapp mainapp
2     Edit settings.py. Fix the following:
        Database settings
        Installed apps
        Media and media admin paths
        Most recently, to add CSS and JS paths
3     Edit urls.py in the project folder and
        Uncomment the admin paths
        Include mainapp.urls.py
4     Create a new urls.py in the mainapp folder
        Create a path that display a view called home
5     Create a new templates folder
6     Create a base.html file in the templates folder
        Create a place-holder variable within base.html
7     Edit the views.py file. Create a new view called home and return ‘hello world’ using the base.html template and a place-holder variable
8     Create a media folder the project folder (1 level up from the mainapp folder)
9     Edit the models.py file
10    Run syncdb
11    At this point, you should be able to access both your admin page and your homepage that outputs ‘hello world’ by running the development server
